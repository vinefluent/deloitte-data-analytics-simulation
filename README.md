# 💼 Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program

**Completed in July 2025 | Hosted on Forage**

This repository contains my work and learnings from the **Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship**, which simulated real-world analytics tasks for Deloitte's clients. The program helped strengthen my data visualization, classification, and analytical reasoning skills using **Tableau** and **Excel**.

## 📊 Task 1: Telemetry Dashboard (Tableau)

- Analyzed telemetry data collected from 4 international factories:
  - Tokyo (Meiyo), Osaka (Seiko), Berlin, Shenzhen
- Created a calculated field for **"Unhealthy"** status (10 mins = 1 downtime unit).
- Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** featuring:
  - **Downtime per Factory**
  - **Downtime per Machine Type**
  - Drill-down filtering by factory
- Identified which location and which devices experienced the most machine failures.

## 📈 Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Analysis (Excel)

- Worked with compensation data across factories and job roles.
- Applied logic to classify **Equality Scores** into 3 classes:
  - `Fair` (±10)
  - `Unfair` (< -10 or > 10)
  - `Highly Discriminative` (< -20 or > 20)
- Added a new **"Equality Class"** column using conditional logic.
- Delivered insights into potential pay bias in multiple regions and roles.
